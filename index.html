                                    <h4>Arlington Heights, IL</h4>
                                    <p>There is no better place on earth for a tool nut than Berland’s House Of Tools,
                                        owned by the Sherman Family. If you live in the Chicagoland area and are involved in the building,
                                        construction or woodworking trades, you probably are familiar with Berland’s. If you need bits,
                                        blades, compressors, routers, hammer drills or any of the 35,000 tools and accessories that Berland’s
                                        stocks, Berland’s is your place. If you are looking for the newest, latest, most innovative tools,
                                         come to Berland’s. Especially the latest in cordless tool technology. “We’re living in a cordless world,” says Dwight “The Toolman” Sherman. Next to the International Hardware Show, you’ve never seen so many tools under one roof. “If we don’t have it, you don’t need it.” If you haven’t visited one of our three sprawling locations, we hope you stop by soon.

                                <p>The Ford Explorer is a range of SUVs manufactured by Ford Motor
                                    Company since the 1991 model year. The first four-door SUV produced
                                    by Ford, the Explorer was introduced as a replacement for the two
                                    -door Bronco II. Deriving its name from a trim package used on
                                    the F-Series pickup trucks (as with the Ranger), the Explorer is
                                    slotted between the Edge CUV and standard-wheelbase Expedition.

                        <h2>Lincoln Aviator</h2>
                        <h4>Assembled in Chicago, IL</h4>
                        <p>The Lincoln Aviator is a mid-size luxury SUV marketed and sold by the Lincoln brand of Ford Motor Company. One of four SUVs offered by Lincoln, the Aviator is currently in its second generation, slotted between the Lincoln Nautilus and Lincoln Navigator in size.

                                The first generation of the Aviator was produced from the 2003 to 2005 model years as a rebadged version of the Mercury Mountaineer (itself based on the Ford Explorer); following the Lincoln Versailles and Lincoln Blackwood pickup truck, the Aviator was one of the shortest-produced vehicles ever sold by Lincoln. For the 2007 model year, Lincoln expanded its use of crossover SUVs; the five-passenger MKX offered a similar exterior footprint while the MKT (introduced in 2009) offered the three-row seating of the Aviator.

                                For the 2020 model year, the Aviator made its return to the Lincoln model line (again based on the Ford Explorer).[3][4] For the first time in a Lincoln-brand vehicle, the Aviator is offered as a plug-in hybrid.

                                The first-generation Aviator was assembled at the now-closed St. Louis Assembly in Hazelwood, Missouri alongside the Explorer and Mountaineer. The second-generation Aviator is assembled at Chicago Assembly in Chicago, Illinois alongside the Explorer and the Ford Police Interceptor Utility.

                <h2>Jeep Cherokee</h2>
                <h4>Assembled in Belvidere, IL</h4>
                <p>The Jeep Cherokee is a line of SUVs manufactured and marketed by Jeep over five generations. Originally marketed as a variant of the Jeep Wagoneer, the Cherokee has evolved from a full-size SUV to one of the first compact SUVs and into its current generation as a crossover SUV. Named after the Cherokee tribe of North American Indians, Jeep has used the nameplate in some capacity since 1974.
                        It was introduced for the 2014 model year at the 2013 New York International Auto Show and the sales started in November 2013.[11][12][12] The Cherokee is the first Jeep vehicle to be built on the Fiat Compact/Compact U.S. Wide platform, co-developed by Chrysler and Fiat.[13] The Jeep Cherokee is built at Belvidere Assembly Plant in Belvidere, Illinois.[14]

                        The Cherokee has a highway fuel economy rating of 31 miles per U.S. gallon (7.6 L/100 km; 37 mpg‑imp)[13] and a 45% better fuel economy rating than the Liberty/Cherokee it replaced.[12][14]

                        In 2019 the front end was updated and a new 2.0L turbo engine became available, with 270 hp and 295 lb.ft. of torque, complementing the 3.2L V-6 a 2.4L inline-4.

        <h2>Jeep Grand Cherokee</h2>
        <h4>Assembled in Belvidere, IL</h4>
        <p>The Jeep Grand Cherokee is a range of mid-size SUV's produced by the American manufacturer Jeep. While some other SUVs were manufactured with body-on-frame construction, the Jeep Grand Cherokee has always used a unibody chassis.[2]
                The fourth-generation WK2 Grand Cherokee went on sale in summer 2010 as a 2011 model.[16] It was unveiled at the 2009 New York Auto Show.[17] In 2009, during its development, Chrysler management used it as an example of future products to convince United States federal regulators of Chrysler's future viability for the purpose of requesting a federal loan. This culminated in the Chrysler Chapter 11 reorganization that same year.
